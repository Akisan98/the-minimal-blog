- Netlify CLI

Use command: ntl dev

### Serverless Function

Using API Keys and other secrets directly in a client side application is a big no-no in the work life / professional environment. That is because a user can still access to the secrets by monitoring the network calls, which defeats the purpose of leaving out secrets of the Git repo. A usual way of solving this problem is the off-load these HTTP calls to our own server or a proxy server, since I really don't need a server for Contentful, I'll be using Serverless Functions at Netlify which is the hosting provider of chose.
